# intro shit

[everything not $NAME:-prefixed appears in box at bottom of screen. $NAME: prefixed stuff should appear in a speech bubble from the protagonist.]

Once upon a time, in a place far away from here in both time, and space...

There lived a young [boy/girl] called [name].

Well, I say _young_. In their twenties.

$NAME: I live here. I want an adventure.

(Don't ask how they own their own house. It's called suspending your sense of disbelief.)

$NAME: I want to go on an adventure. I want destiny. 

$NAME: I want a sense of purpose.

$NAME: And a cat.

Not all wishes come true.

But - lo, what's this?

[like asteroid comes down & little sleeping cat appears or summat]

$NAME: A cat! That'll do!

This will all end in tears.

But not yet. What do cats eat?
